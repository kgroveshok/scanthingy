Scanner and Print Server

CUPS config based on https://samhobbs.co.uk/2014/07/raspberry-pi-print-scanner-server


Setup

1. Use (with any possible changes for your environment) the install.sh script to 
build all the bits

2. Set SCANDOCS in your bashrc to point to where you want the scanner doc root to be
by default it will be ~/Documents/Scanner

That's it really!

Then use desktop_client.sh to fire up the menu and get scanning :-)
